				The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday reported 5,290 new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, bringing the total to 640,984, even as 8 laboratories failed to submit data on time.<br><br>

				This marks the seventh consecutive day where more than 4,000 daily cases were reported.<br><br>

				According to the DOH, this pushed the total active cases to 66,567, setting a new record-high for this year.<br><br>

				Of this, 93.3 percent are mild, 3.7 percent are asymptomatic, 1.2 percent are severe, and 1.2 percent are in critical condition.<br><br>

				Meanwhile, total recoveries rose to 561,530 after 439 more patients recovered from the illness while 21 new fatalities brought the death toll to 12,887.<br><br>

				Four duplicate cases were also removed from the total case count.

				“Moreover, 6 cases that were previously tagged as recoveries were reclassified as deaths after final validation,” the DOH said.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="pics/c31.png" width="580"><br><br>

				Data from the DOH also showed that 51 percent of the country’s intensive care unit beds are available while 72 percent of the mechanical ventilators are ready for use.<br><br>

				An expert from OCTA Research group earlier recommended to the national government to prioritize the vaccination rollout in the National Capital Region.<br><br>

				Moody’s Analytics has said that the Philippines is not likely to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 until 2023, which could slow the pace of its economic recovery.<br><br>

				Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration said 3.1% or 7,469 of the 240,297 individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 has reported an adverse event following immunization.<br><br>
