				Metro Manila's intensive care unit (ICU) beds for COVID-19 patients are now 64% full, an alarming developent according to Health Undersecretary Leopoldo Vega.<br><br>

				“Yes. The numbers, moderate risk na kasi iyan. It’s alarming, we can be very comfortable ‘pag low risk talaga, below mga 30% ano,” Vega said in a Palace briefing when asked if the 64% occupancy rate of the ICU beds was a cause for alarm.<br><br>

				[We can be very comfortable if it is at a low risk level].<br><br>

				“But this is already 60%, so alarming but we need to do something. We have to do the appropriate response in terms of capacitating our hospitals, both public and private, here in Metro Manila,” Vega said.<br><br>

				Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that quarantine restrictions would be changed accordingly if the increase in health care utilization rate would continue.<br><br>

				“If we reach the danger level which is the red zone, that may be a ground to increase the quarantine classification," Roque said.<br><br>

				"But we have One Hospital Command Center and Dr. Vega gas assured that we can possibly augment our healthcare capacity in Metro Manila by utilizing the healthcare capacity of the regions adjoining Metro Manila, including Calabarzon and Central Luzon,” he added.<br><br>

				“We will see, because with One Hospital Command Center, Dr. Vega will be able to estimate if we would really run short of beds or otherwise," Roque said.<br><br>

				"I would say it is a bit of a reason to be alarmed, but given that the people are now mobilizing themselves and concentrating on lowering the numbers, we will see the results of these measures to halt the rise in cases of COVID-19,” he added.<br><br>

				Based on Health department records, the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic is Metro Manila with over 25,000 new COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days.<br><br>
